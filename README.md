# Wellington Water annoys the fuck out of me

[With some regularity they post a progress update to their website.](https://www.wellingtonwater.co.nz/resources/topic/water-conservation/leaks/leak-stats/) The problem is that this doesn't really show progres over time.

Sure they tell you how many leaks there are, and how many they are fixing. There are some impressive numbers, 500+ leaks fixed in December last year, but what kind of delta did that create? Did that actually reduce the number of leaks?

## Data gets analysed slightly here

For the last 4 months the number of leaks has stayed pretty consistently over 3000. Only momentarily dipping below 3000 for a brief time.

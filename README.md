# Wellington Water annoys the fuck out of me

[With some regularity they post a progress update to their website.](https://www.wellingtonwater.co.nz/resources/topic/water-conservation/leaks/leak-stats/) The problem is that this doesn't really show progres over time.

Sure they tell you how many leaks there are, and how many they are fixing. And they are impressive numbers. 500+ in December last year. But if we have 500 new leaks in december, then it means didly squat.

I started with diving into the web archive for older versions of their dashboard to try and get a better picture of this. I noticed that even if the web archive didn't have a copy of the published dashboard, the old files were still live on their website!

So I wrote a script to brute force try various combinations, download them, and let me browse, and collate. This wasn't as fruitful as I'd have liked, only providing 7 data points, but it's 6 more than I had when I started.

## Data presented here

## Data gets analysed slightly here

With more data comes new conclusions. The numbers are once again moving upwards, this is as a frustrating reversal of a previous promising trend.

~~Overall it appears as though there is a slow, but steady, decline in the over all leak count over the last 3 months.~~

~~Wellington Water needs to keep this up for more than 3 months if they want to win any amount of trust.~~

## Archiving the reports

I've archived the reports here, because I don't trust Wellington Water to keep them live if they realize people are actually tracking their progress.
